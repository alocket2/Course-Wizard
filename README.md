Everyday you should update your local version of the project.
Do not update the project when you are working on a feature,
finish the feature push it then update the project after I
have merged your feature.
Open your terminal and go to your Course-Wizard directory

This will update the cocoapods and install any new pods
When that is done run the following command

This will pull any new files into your project and keep it up to date with the repo.
